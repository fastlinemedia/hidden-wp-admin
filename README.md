Hidden WP Admin
=============

This plugin allows you to hide the WordPress admin, login and signup pages from all users except those with a specific capability. Unauthorized users will be redirected via a 301 redirect to your site's homepage or a URL that you specify in the settings.

This plugin is useful if you want to allow signups for your site but only want users with a certain capability (e.g. edit_others_pages for editor and administrator) to be able to access the admin area. This helps to ensure that malicious users can't access something that you didn't intend for them to access.

You are also given the option to redirect the WordPress login and signup pages to your own custom pages. Redirecting those pages in addition to the admin can also help secure your site from someone trying to attack those URLs.
